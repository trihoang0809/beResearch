# beResearch
This is my research on the Valhalla open-source project for Be Group.

**Introduction**

[Valhalla]([url](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla)) is an open-source routing engine and accompanying libraries for use with OpenStreetMap data. Valhalla also includes tools like time+distance matrix computation, isochrones, elevation sampling, map matching, and tour optimization (Travelling Salesman).

**My tasks**

My primary goal was to get used to all of Valhalla's features and functionalities while testing its feasibility in terms of utilizing it in the current eco-system of Be. Throughout the process, I used tools and technologies such as JavaScript, Docker, and k6 load testing, etc. I developed simple programs that use Valhalla to generate random points in a specific region, verify the reachability of locations, and generate routes between two input points.

**Notes**

The project is still ongoing. The next big step is simulating my programs under the company's traffic and see how they perform.
